    "The team decided that the variable housing would be of interest to the banks as this could be an avenue for additional revenue for the industry.  Individuals and families that own homes could be swayed into refinancing homes for a lower interest rate or need other loans to pay for home improvements.  These transactions, though benefiting the home owner in the short term, in the long run banks do benefit additionally with fees and service transactions that must be paid.\n",
    "\n",
    "The housing variable is a binary response that is balanced in our sampled data set (the population of the bank clients that have a home loan are unknown).  The variable represents if the client has or does not have a home loan.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the figure 1 we can see several trends happening during the time of the data set (ref: https://tradingeconomics.com/portugal):\n",
    "- Household savings increasing\n",
    "- Bank lending decreasing\n",
    "- Average wage increasing\n",
    "- Consumer spending decreasing\n",

    "During the time of the marketing campaign, a global recession occurred (figure 2).  We inferred that to prepare for the possiblity of upcoming hardships, many individuals/families would have attemped to save more of their disposable income.  The above charts yields us to that inference.  The banks could use this data to direct resources in an attempt to help these home owners refinance and save additional disposable income.  This helps out the customers in the short term and helps out the bank in the long term now that they have gained customers and revenue from interest payments. \n",

    "In this task, we are predicting whether a bank client has a housing loan. 56% of the clients in this data set have housing loan and the remaining 44% do not, which  dataset is closely balanced for this task.

    "From a business standpoint, it is equally important to know who has a loan or not. Banks could offer additional promotions regarding home refinancing for customers who have housing loans.  Similarly, if the bank wants to attract new home owners, they can contact people who do not have housing loans. Correct prediction is more important for this model and accuracy is chosen as a metric to evaluate the models.\n",
    "This will be followed by AuC scores, as accuracy is  calculated at a threshold value of 0.5.  In real life, the probability of the population having a housing loan is not 50-50.  This data set was collected at time of economic recession, so it is  likely that prior probabilities of people having housing loan were not at 50-50 level. (reference:  https://tradingeconomics.com/portugal/home-ownership-rate shows in 2010 the home ownership rate was ~75%, no 2008-2009 data was found) . Hence, AuC score (in conjunction to ROC curve) score which basically provides accuracies at different threshold values, would overall provide a better measure of model performance.\n"

Since we are sampling from the entire dataset during each iteration, values selected during one iteration, could be selected again during another iteration.

    "As identified during the EDA in Lab 1, the clients could be contacted over a few months, but each of the months listed corresponds to the last month the client was contacted.  The months that affect the housing model the most are August, June, May and July.   It is necessary to note the difference between the housing and the subscribe models - the subscribe model does not weight any months with a high coefficient until the fifth variable.  Also, most of the months in the housing model have negative coeffecients where the subscribe model are equally distributed between the months. \n",

    "The age of the client, which is the first non-month feature, is in the top 6.  The age of prospective clients for home loans sounds as if that feature would be significant, for example a 30 year old person is more likely to have a home loan as compared to an 18 year old.  \n",

    "Pdays is the last feature we will mention as significant (we were going to only mention the top 5 but continued until the next non-month attribute).  Pdays is also the first non-month attribute to have a positive coefficient with Month_May being the only other feature mentioned here.  Pdays is the number of days of contact between the current marketing campaign and a previous campaign.  From the EDA in Lab 1, we discovered that 80% of the clients in this campaign were new to marketing campaigns from the bank.  The right skewness of the data for this feature could have affected the singifance into the model."

    "The models that we have derived, for both home loans and subscription to term deposits,  are of interest to the bank.  Banks, similar to other businesses, have a business case to increase customer base (or increase what current customers use the bank for) without increasing (or decrease) their customer acquisition cost.  We have focused on building predictive models for existing bank customers and would not affect the acquisiton cost for new customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to benefit the bank's sales, the banks could use these models to increase probability of the customers they phone that ultimately will subscribe to a term deposit or invest in a home.  This reduces the number of phone calls, reduces the hours that are paid to the bankers to make those phone calls and increases the probaility of the banks earning interest on the term deposits or home loans.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would encourage the bankers to continue to enter the data in order to refine the model at a later date.  Market changes could effect the models' accuracy and continuing to collect data will make it simplier to refine for the next campaign.  Since the models do not need to be used for each phone call, the use of the model can be deployed to a few people in the bank and then the list of more likely candidates be distributed to the bankers that will be contacting the existing customers.  The use of the models could also be added to the process during signing up new customers.  The bank could run the model on the attributes of the new customer and then make offers on the spot if the model shows the determined level of probability. \n",
    "\n",
    "The attribute that we believe would refine the models even further and increase the models' performance is income.  Income is important to home loans as it shows purchasing power on average homes in the neighborhood.  Income is important to term deposits as it is an indicator on disposable income of the customers to save more. \n",

(Despite us not knowing the randomness of the sample or the calls, we are going to assume that they were random in this case and we can use the model to predict the subscribe or housing outcomes to the entire bank population).\n"
