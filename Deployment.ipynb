    "## Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "The models that we have derived, for both home loans and subscription to term deposits,  are of interest to the bank.  Banks, similar to other businesses, have a business case to increase customer base (or increase what current customers use the bank for) without increasing (or decrease) their customer acquisition cost.  We have focused on building predictive models for existing bank customers and would not affect the acquisiton cost for new customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to benefit the bank's sales, the banks could use these models to increase probability of the customers they phone that ultimately will subscribe to a term deposit or invest in a home.  This reduces the number of phone calls, reduces the hours that are paid to the bankers to make those phone calls and increases the probaility of the banks earning interest on the term deposits or home loans.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would encourage the bankers to continue to enter the data in order to refine the model at a later date.  Market changes could effect the models' accuracy and continuing to collect data will make it simplier to refine for the next campaign.  Since the models do not need to be used for each phone call, the use of the model can be deployed to a few people in the bank and then the list of more likely candidates be distributed to the bankers that will be contacting the existing customers.  The use of the models could also be added to the process during signing up new customers.  The bank could run the model on the attributes of the new customer and then make offers on the spot if the model shows the determined level of probability. \n",
    "\n",
    "The attribute that we believe would refine the models even further and increase the models' performance is income.  Income is important to home loans as it shows purchasing power on average homes in the neighborhood.  Income is important to term deposits as it is an indicator on disposable income of the customers to save more. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model could be refined in any time intervals, but at a minimum the model should be updated <font color = blue> % change in the market, national interst rate adjustments, % in unemployment </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:  We have no evidence that these models can be extrapolated to other banks in Portugal or other countries.  (Despite us not knowing the randomness of the sample or the calls, we are going to assume that they were random in this case and we can use the model to predict the subscribe or housing outcomes to the entire bank population).\n",
